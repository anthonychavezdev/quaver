# Quaver
A Discord bot used to play music on Discord.

It's nowhere near to being finished, and the codebase is rather messy.

## Dependencies
You'll need python3, pip, and youtube-dl.
After you have those, you can install the python libraries with:

```sh
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Connecting the bot to Discord
